      " Current Answer: The Pandavas had to go live in the forest for 12 years because they lost their kingdom in a gambling match and were exiled as a result. They were forced to spend their time in the forest as part of their punishment. Bhima, one of the Pandavas, found it difficult to tolerate the ascetic life in the forest and contemplated killing all of the Kurus, but his brother Yudhisthira always pacified him and advised against it. During their time in the forest, the Pandavas received knowledge from sages and saintly persons. The great sage Vyasa informed them that many generals had agreed to support their cousin Duryodhana, including Karna, Shakuni, Bhurishravas, Sala, Drona, and Bhishma. Vyasa also told Arjuna that if he were to fight in a future war, he would need to obtain the divine astras of Lord Indra and Lord Shiva. After Vyasa's departure, Yudhisthira ordered Arjuna to go to the Himalayan mountains to perform austerities to please Lord Shiva. The Pandavas then continued their journey to the Kamyaka forest, where they made their home. \n",

      " Current Answer: The specific reason that led the Pandavas to go live in the forest for 12 years was the result of a game of dice. In this game, the Pandavas lost their kingdom, wealth, and even their wife Draupadi to the Kauravas, their cousins. As per the rules of the game, the Pandavas were exiled to the forest for twelve years and an additional year incognito. This was the punishment imposed on them by the Kauravas. The Pandavas, being righteous and obedient, accepted the verdict and left their kingdom to live in the forest. Bhima, one of the Pandavas, found it difficult to tolerate the ascetic life in the forest, but his brother Yudhisthira always pacified him and reminded him that it was not the opportune time to fulfill their desires. During their time in the forest, they received knowledge from sages and saintly persons, and it was during this period that the sage Vyasa informed them about the generals who had agreed to support Duryodhana.

According to the context, the Pandavas had lost their kingdom in a gambling match and were exiled to the forest for a period of twelve years. This was part of the agreement made during the game, where they were to live incognito in the forest for twelve years and spend an additional year in disguise without being recognized by anyone.
