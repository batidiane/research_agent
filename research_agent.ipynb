When Surya appeared and Kunti realized that she was going to have a child, she became fearful and regretful. However, Surya informed her that the mantra could not be undone, and she had to bear the consequences of her actions. Therefore, when the baby was born, Kunti put him in a basket and set him adrift in a river. The exact reason for her decision to abandon the child is not explicitly mentioned in the given context, but it can be inferred that Kunti did so out of fear, regret, and possibly a sense of responsibility towards her other sons and her position as a queen. \n",

As stated in the context, Kunti had conceived a child by the sun god Surya before her marriage to Pandu. However, she was ashamed of begetting a son while still unmarried, so she decided to hide the child. Kunti placed the baby in a basket and set it afloat on the river Ganges to ensure that her secret would not be discovered by her family. She wept bitterly and was afflicted with grief, but she had to let go of her son to protect herself and her reputation. The child, named Karna, was eventually found and raised by a carpenter and his wife.
