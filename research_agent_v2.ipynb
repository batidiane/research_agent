      "\u001b[34mThe procedure for winding down a private limited company depends on the circumstances. If the company is dissolved, ceases to carry on business, or is only carrying on business for the purpose of winding up its affairs, it may be wound up. If the company is unable to pay its debts or if the Tribunal deems it just and equitable, the company may also be wound up. The mode of proceedings for winding up by the Tribunal, as well as for voluntary winding up by members or creditors, is specified. Meetings of creditors and members may be held in connection with the winding up process. Costs, charges, and expenses incurred in the winding up, including the fee of the Company Liquidator, are payable out of the company's assets in priority to other claims. The manner of disposing of the liquidator may be directed by the Tribunal or by special resolution with the approval of creditors. After five years from the dissolution of the company, no responsibility shall devolve. The specific procedure for winding up, such as dividing assets among members, may require the sanction of a special resolution and other required approvals.\u001b[39m\n",

An unregistered company can be wound up if it is dissolved, has ceased to carry on business, is only carrying on business for the purpose of winding up its affairs, is unable to pay its debts, or if the Tribunal deems it just and equitable. The process for winding up a company can be determined by the Tribunal, and there are specific provisions for voluntary winding up by members or creditors, as well as for meetings of creditors and members.
